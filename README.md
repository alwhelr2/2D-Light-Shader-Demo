# 2D-Light-Shader-Demo
Usage of shaders to apply lights to and shadows to a 2D environment defined by polygons such as triangles and squares.  Shader reads in walls and light data, then performs raycasting calculations to define lighting and shadows.

Project leveraged use of C# within the Monogame framework with HLSL for the lighting and shadow shader code.
